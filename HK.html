												<p>
													Henry Knox was born July 25, 1750, in Boston, Massachusetts. Knox was born to William and Mary Knox, with his father being a shipbuilder who died when Knox was young. At the young age of 9, Knox became a clerk in a bookstore to support his mother, and it was here that the boy would develop an affinity for war and politics by reading through the books. It also lead to him opening his own book shop, the <i>London Book Store</i>, in Boston in 1771, and married a women named Lucy Flucker in 1774. 
												</p>
												<p>When the Revolutionary War broke out, Knox and his wife left the book store to join the Continental Army. The Continental Army commenced the Siege of Boston, which is where Knox would meet <a href="GW.html">George Washington</a>. It is here that Knox would lead the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_train_of_artillery" target="_blank">“Noble Train of Artillery”</a>, where he would lead an expedition of sixty tons of cannons and other armaments throughout the winter of 1775-1776. This was a major accomplishment on Knox’s part, and the route he took is even marked today as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Knox_Trail" target="_blank">“Henry Knox Trail”</a>.</p>

											<h2>Secretary of War</h2>
											<p>It is as the Secretary of War that Knox enters the discussion of the Native Americans. Many of his decisions can be found on the <a href="PFP.html">Plans for Peace</a> page. To keep it simple, Knox argued that the Native Americans deserved their right to soil, and that going to war or forcing them off of their land would be disastrous to the United States.</p>

												<h3>Pragmatic Reasoning</h3>
												<p>
													The reasons why Knox argued for this could be said as purely pragmatic. After all, he was concerned about the United States first and foremost. He believed that it would sully the reputation of the young nation to attack the Native Americans, and he saw that the cost of doing so would be too much, both in terms of money and lives lost. He also believed that “civilizing” the Native Americans would be the best option, which, as said elsewhere, would have terrible consequences.
												</p>
												</section>
												<section>
												<h3>Emotional Reasoning</h3>
												<p>On the other hand, it could be see that Knox genuinely believed in treating the Native Americans like actual people, just in a misguided way. He seemed to be aware that if the settlers and frontiers were not pushed back, the Native Americans would be wiped out. As he wrote to George Washington on July 7, 1789:</p>
												<q>“If the same causes continue, the same effects will happen and in a short period the idea of an Indian on this side of the Mississippi will only be found in the pages of the historian.”</q>
												<p>He also vehemently opposed men like <a href="ASC.html">Arthur St. Clair</a>, believing that the Native Americans should be compensated in some form to fairly obtain their land. Even beyond that, Knox blamed the settlers for inciting violence against the Native Americans, calling them “lawless whites” and even though he believed that the “young savages” in the Native American tribes were prone to violence, he did not disregard that the settlers were also to blame.</p>

											<section>
												<h3>Unsolved Issue</h3>
												<p>
													All in all, it’s not out of field to say that Knox wasn’t ultimately successful. He left office in 1795, unable to stop the settlers or come up with an appropriate solution to dealing with the Native Americans. Washington himself has some blame for this as well, considering he was President, but both men couldn’t protect both the Native Americans and the settlers at the same time. Knox spent his entire career trying solve the problem, but couldn’t find a solution with the opposition.
