													By the mid-1780s, the federal government realized that they needed a different approach with the Native Americans, especially if they wanted to expand. To this end, it was decided that <a href="HK.html">Henry Knox</a> would be the man for the job. Appointed the Secretary of War in 1789, Knox was a man who had the knowledge to at least offer up an alternative solution to the Native Americans. Knox understood, as a military man, that the Native Americans would not go down without a fight, and that attempting to crush their resistance would not be feasible. The young United States simply did not have the money or the manpower to go to war with the Native American tribes.

												<h3>The Constitution</h3>
												<p>
												Something interesting to point out here is that the Constitution itself only mentions the Native Americans as a foreign power. It states that Congress has the power to…
												</p>
												<q>“...Regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.”</q>
												<p>I think it says much about the United States at the time that they considered the Native Americans to be a foreign power even though they lived on the continent first. Regardless, this would be the first attempt to regulate who negotiates with the Native Americans in the United States.</p>
												</aside>
												<section>
												<h3>Knox’s Plans</h3>
												<p>Knox argued, in an address to the President, that the right of soil belonged to the Native Americans, as they lived on the land first. </p>
												<q>“The Indians, being the prior occupants, possess the right of the soil. It cannot be taken from them unless by their free consent, or by the right of conquest in case of a just war”.</q>
												<p>If the United States did attempt to force the Native Americans off of the land, it would be a stain to their legacy, and it would be against the higher purpose of the United States.</p>
												<q>“To dispossess them on any other principle, would be a gross violation of the fundamental laws of nature, and of that distributive justice which is the glory of a nation”.</q>
												<p>With this idea, Knox believed that the federal government should be in charge of negotiating with the Native Americans, as it was a matter that went beyond the state governments. Knox’s ideas was to obtain the land through other means. He wanted to have talks with the Native Americans over the land, and to pay for any trouble when a reasonable agreement was reached. This payment would take the form of civilization, with teachers and agricultural technology that could help “civilize” the tribes. Knox believed that this policy would not only save lives and money, but would also help expansion and the United States’ honor.</p>

												<h3>Civilization</h3>
												<p>
													You’ve probably seen this before on the other pages. The idea is rather simple, in that the United States believed that the only way to help the Native Americans was to “civilize” them. This meant shifting their culture to the agricultural, Christian culture that the United States had adopted. While it is arguable that this policy had good intentions, it still didn’t stop the settlers from attacking the Native Americans, and arguably lead to the <a href="RAM.html">Trail of Tears</a> that happened years later.
